# Simple Sudoku Solver #
A simple sudoku solver  in Python. Currently solves easy sudokus but not difficult ones.

Contains two examples in the `main.py` script.

Should be able to handle any size sudoku as long as it is a square overall. Define the grid (the internal squares that need solving) size in 
`grid_x` and `grid_y`.
